Thanks for checking out StarGazer! This is a work in progress blogging platform based on the works of imathis over at [Octopress]. It is designed to be quick to develop within, and aims to be light-wieght and responsive.

You can host this on a [Github] subdomain: `username.github.io` for easy deployment, but StarGazer offers you the ability to host elsewhere. Be it your own machine or Heroku, StarGazer has you covered!
