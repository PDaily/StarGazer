### Configuration

Now that you have your StarGazer app installed, lets get it configured! I'm striving to make StarGazer as easy to work with as possible. The most you should have to change is your `_config.yml` and possibly your `Rakefile` until you get into [theming] your blog.

These files are a part of configuration:

{% codeblock %}
  _config.yml   # Main site configuration
{% endcodeblock %}
