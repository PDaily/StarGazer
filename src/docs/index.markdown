## StarGazer Documentation

StarGazer is a project built from the love I had with Jekyll and eventually Octopress. While StarGazer stives to stand apart from other blogging platforms, we will never forget our roots! This project is a major work in progress and if you have any questions, please refer to these documents and send us an [issue] if you need further help!


If you find any errors, please submit an [issue] or fork the project and submit a pull request.
