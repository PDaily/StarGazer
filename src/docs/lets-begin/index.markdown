### Lets Begin!

As this is a Jekyll based project, you DO need to be familiar with shell commands and git. As such, there are a few things you need to have ready on your system.

You will need:

  * Git
  * Ruby (Preferably 2.0 or higher)
  
#### Setup StarGazer

Lets go ahead and download the source files:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:PDaily/stargazer.git stargazer
$ cd stargazer
```

Once we are in our working directory, install required dependancies:

```
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```
